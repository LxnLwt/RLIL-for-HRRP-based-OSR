Dataset Preparation
-------
In train.py, we evaluate four OSR scenarios: Scenarios 1 and 2 utilize measured HRRPs, while Scenarios 3 and 4 employ simulated HRRPs. The partitioning of known and unknown classes for all four scenarios is summarized below. The simulated HRRPs used in this study are available at https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/sysu-hrrp-aircraft-10-sha1-2.
